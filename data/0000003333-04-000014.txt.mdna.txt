Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.

Overview
     During the past three years, the Company announced a variety of actions and
programs the leadership team has identified and  implemented  with the intent to
drive the Company's future competitiveness, profitability and return on invested
capital.  The Company continues to be focused on its five strategic  imperatives
that serve as a guide and a filter for all the Company's initiatives.  The food,
drug and general merchandise  retailing industry continues to experience intense
competition with numerous competitors.  The Company is competing through planned
investments  in pricing and  promotion,  product  differentiation  and  customer
service. The Company's 2003 results of operations were unfavorably impacted by a
labor dispute with its retail union associates in southern California that began
on October 12, 2003 and lasted  through the  remainder of the  Company's  fiscal
year which ended on January 29, 2004 ("Labor Dispute").

     All dollar amounts in this report are in millions, except per share data.

Southern California Labor Dispute
     Pursuant to the terms of a multi-employer  bargaining arrangement among the
Company, The Kroger Co. and Safeway Inc. (the "Retailers"),  the Company "locked
out" its retail union  associates in southern  California food stores on October
12,  2003.  This  followed  the United  Food and  Commercial  Workers'  ("UFCW")
decision  to  conduct  a strike  at  Safeway  Inc.'s  southern  California  Vons
Supermarket stores on October 11, 2003.

     In   connection   with  the   decision  of  the   Retailers  to  engage  in
multi-employer  bargaining with the UFCW, the Retailers  entered into agreements
("Labor Dispute  Agreements") which provided for lock-outs in the event that any
Retailer was struck at any or all of its facilities in southern  California when
the other  Retailers were not and contained a provision  designed to prevent the
union  from  placing  disproportionate  pressure  on one  or  more  Retailer  by
picketing such Retailer(s) but not the other Retailer(s).  Payments are expected
to be made or received under the Labor Dispute  Agreements during the first half
of fiscal 2004 at which time only net amounts will be paid.

     In November 2003, three consumers filed an action in California state court
claiming  that the Labor  Dispute  Agreements  violate  antitrust  and  consumer
protection laws. In February 2004, the California Attorney General filed suit in
federal court claiming that certain  provisions of the Labor Dispute  Agreements
violate  antitrust  law. The Company  believes that similar  agreements  are not
uncommon in joint  bargaining  situations and that the Labor Dispute  Agreements
are lawful. The Company is vigorously defending itself in these proceedings.

     The Labor Dispute  resulted in decreased  sales in the  Company's  southern
California  combination food and drug and conventional food stores and decreased
margin  as a result  of  inventory  shrink,  sales  mix  changes  and  increased
distribution  costs.  The Company also incurred  additional costs for hiring and
training  temporary  workers,   travel  costs  for  temporarily  reassigned  key
associates  from other Company  divisions,  increased  store  security and legal
costs.  These impacts were  partially  offset by reduced labor  expenses and the
estimated benefit from the multi-employer  bargaining agreement discussed above.
The Labor Dispute ended with the  ratification  of a new  collective  bargaining
agreement on February 28, 2004. Under the terms of the new collective bargaining
agreement,  the  Company  agreed to fund a  one-time  contribution  to the union
health  and  welfare  fund  of  approximately  $36 as  well  as to  make  strike
ratification  bonus payments of approximately $10. These amounts will be charged
to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004.  Other specific impacts of
the Labor  Dispute on the  Company's  2003 results of  operations  are discussed
below.

Acquisition of Shaw's
     On March 25, 2004, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with
J Sainsbury  plc and JS USA  Holdings  Inc.  to acquire  all of the  outstanding
capital  stock of the  entities  which  conduct J  Sainsbury  plc's U.S.  retail
grocery  store  business  for  approximately  $2,100  in  cash,  as  well as the
assumption of approximately $368 in capital leases. The Company intends to use a
combination of  cash-on-hand  and  commercial  paper to finance a portion of the
purchase price of the  acquisition.  The commercial paper the Company intends to
issue will be backed by the Company's  existing credit  facilities  and/or a new
senior  revolving  bridge  facility.  The Company's also  contemplating  various
financing alternatives, including the issuance of debt and/or equity, to finance
a portion of the purchase price and/or to repay some of the commercial paper.

     The operations to be acquired consist of  approximately  200 grocery stores
in the New England area operated under the banners Shaw's and Star Markets.  The
operations to be acquired ("Shaw's") had  sales of approximately  $4,600 for the
fiscal year ended February 28, 2004 and approximately $4,400 for the fiscal year
ended March 1, 2003.

     The  acquisition  is  expected  to  close  in the  second  quarter  of 2004
following the  satisfaction or waiver of certain closing  conditions,  including
the  expiration  or  termination  of the  applicable  waiting  period  under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino  Act and Shaw's fiscal year ended  February 28, 2004 financial
statement audit reflecting a specified  minimum EBITDA.  Because of the goodwill
that is expected to be  generated  as a result of the  acquisition,  the Company
will  have to  obtain  prospective  waivers  from the  lenders  under two of the
Company's  existing credit  facilities in order to remain in compliance with the
consolidated tangible net worth covenant contained in the agreements. No amounts
were outstanding under these facilities as of January 29, 2004.

Strategic Imperatives
     The Company's leadership team has identified many actions and programs with
which to drive the Company's future competitiveness, profitability and return on
invested  capital.  The Company  continues  to be focused on its five  strategic
imperatives  that  serve  as a  guide  and a  filter  for  all of the  Company's
initiatives.  These five  imperatives,  together with the major actions taken to
date, follow:

1)   Aggressive  Cost and  Process  Control.  Each  main  category  of  expense,
     including  labor,  is monitored by a member of  executive  management.  The
     Company  committed to achieve annual cost  reductions and cost avoidance of
     $750 by the end of 2004. By the end of 2003,  the Company had achieved $609
     of the $750 cost reduction  goal. In February  2004, the Company  announced
     that it had  raised its total  cost-out  goal to $1,000 by the end of 2005.
     This additional $250 in cost savings is expected to be achieved through new
     supply chain initiatives.

2)   Maximize  Return on Invested  Capital.  The Company has a formal process to
     review and measure all  significant  investments in corporate  assets.  The
     Company's  goal is to hold a number one or two market share in an area,  or
     have a plan of action which provides a reasonable  expectation of achieving
     this goal in order to continue to maintain an investment in that area. This
     process  involves  thorough  review at both the  individual  asset or store
     level and at the market area level.

     As a result  of these  reviews,  the  Company  closed  or  disposed  of 165
     underperforming  stores,  sold 80 non-core New England Osco  drugstores and
     reduced its  division  offices  from 19 to 15 in 2001.  In 2002 the Company
     exited four underperforming  markets resulting in the sale or closure of 95
     stores, two distribution  centers and the reduction of its division offices
     from 15 to 11. In 2003 the Company  closed 61  underperforming  stores.  On
     January 30, 2004, the Company announced a new  organizational  structure in
     its Dallas/Fort  Worth division  intended to eliminate layers of management
     and streamline  operations and, on February 20, 2004, the Company announced
     plans to further  consolidate  its 11  divisions to seven and add an eighth
     division to develop new formats, including price impact stores.

3)   Customer-focused  Approach to Growth. The Company intends to invest many of
     the savings  from its expense and process  control  programs  back into the
     marketplace  in order to drive sales and  earnings  growth.  The  Company's
     focus is on the  following  programs  that are  intended to drive  customer
     loyalty and profitable sales growth:


     o    A company-wide "Service First, Second to None" program to reinvigorate
          the employees' focus on customer service.
     o    The "Focus on Fresh" initiative to improve the delivery of fresh foods
          throughout the Company's fresh departments.
     o    A decade-long  development  of the dual branding  format that provides
          food and drugstore offerings in one location under multiple banners.

4)   Company-wide Focus on Technology.  Albertsons use of technology is designed
     to better  serve  customers  and improve  operating  efficiencies.  In 2002
     Albertsons  established an information technology plan, which calls for the
     replacement  or upgrade of over  three-quarters  of the  Company's  current
     systems by 2007. The Company  initiated a project that will standardize all
     front-end  point-of-sale  systems; built a new data center resulting in the
     consolidation  of two  previous  data  centers;  and started the process of
     implementing a new financial  applications  system.  In 2003, the first two
     phases of the  Company's  new  financial  system were  completed  and a new
     online recruitment tool was rolled out providing  consistent  processes and
     automation that transformed the way Albertsons  identifies,  interviews and
     hires  quality  associates  across  the  enterprise.  Technology  has  been
     deployed in approximately 384 stores in  "self-checkout"  lanes,  providing
     customers with the option to complete their shopping trips  electronically.
     The  Company  has also been  piloting a handheld  scanner  that the Company
     describes  as  the  Shop N Scan  program  that  allows  customers  to  scan
     merchandise  as they walk  through  and shop a store.  The Company has also
     invested in the technology to drive its supply chain  initiatives.  Late in
     fiscal  2003,  the Company  signed an  agreement  for several  planning and
     analytical  modules to improve supply chain efficiency.  In March 2004, the
     Company  launched a Radio  Frequency  Identification  (RFID)  test  program
     intended to improve efficiencies in consumer demand chain management.


                                       16

5)   Energized  Associates.  The  Albertsons  leadership  team is  charged  with
     creating an uplifting  atmosphere for  associates  and to inspire  positive
     attitudes  throughout the Company.  To ensure that associates are energized
     and motivated to do their best work,  the Company  realigned  processes and
     programs to provide  new  opportunities  for  associates  to achieve  their
     professional  career goals.  The Company changed  compensation  programs to
     reward  performance  that  delivers  results,  improved  communications  so
     associates are better informed,  streamlined education programs to meet the
     needs  of  the  business  and  revised  benefits  plans  to  reduce  costs.
     Albertsons  is convinced  that a team of energized  associates  who share a
     positive  attitude will achieve  Albertsons  goal of becoming the best food
     and drug retailer in the world.

</TABLE>

     Sales decreased $190 in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to the Labor
Dispute. The Labor Dispute resulted in decreased sales in the Company's southern
California  combination food and drug and conventional  stores.  These decreases
were  partially  offset by an increased  number of  operating  stores in 2003 as
compared to 2002. In 2003,  identical  store sales decreased 2.8% as compared to
2002. Identical stores are defined as stores that have been in operation for two
full fiscal years. Comparable store sales, which uses the same store base as the
identical  store  sales  computation  except  it  includes  replacement  stores,
decreased  2.4% in 2003 as  compared  to  2002.  Excluding  food  stores  in the
Company's Southern  California  Division for the last 110 days of 2003 and 2002,
identical store sales  decreased 0.5% and comparable  store sales decreased 0.1%
in 2003 as compared to 2002.  Management  estimates  that  overall  inflation in
products the Company  sells was 0.5% in the 12 months ended  January 29, 2004 as
compared  to an overall  deflation  of 0.1% in the 12 months  ended  January 30,
2003.

     Despite the year to year declines in identical and comparable  store sales,
when  adjusted  for the Labor  Dispute  the  Company  saw  improvements  in both
identical and  comparable  store sales in the second half of 2003 as compared to
the first half of 2003.

     The following table reconciles  actual identical store sales and comparable
store sales to adjusted  identical  store  sales and  comparable  store sales as
presented herein. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because
it believes a  comparison  of actual to  adjusted  store sales data is useful to
investors to communicate  management's belief of the impact of the Labor Dispute
on trends in sales experienced during the last 110 days of 2003.

     During 2003 the Company  opened 50  combination  food and drug  stores,  27
stand-alone  drugstores,  two  conventional  and  warehouse  stores  and 29 fuel
centers.  The Company  closed or sold 15  combination  food and drug stores,  18
conventional  stores and 28 stand-alone  drugstores.  The Company also remodeled
192 stores. Net retail square footage of continuing  operations was 94.0 million
square feet at the end of 2003 as compared to 92.1 million square feet in 2002.

     Sales  decreased  in  2002  as  compared  to  2001  due  to  the  Company's
restructuring  activities  initiated in July 2001. In 2001 the Company announced
closure of 165 stores in  addition to selling 80 New  England  Osco  drugstores.
These 245 stores'  sales are included in 2001 and 2002  operating  results until
their  actual  closure  or  disposition.  Sales in 2002  were also  impacted  by
declining  consumer  confidence,  as measured by The Conference  Board Index, of
78.8  in  January  2003 as  compared  to 97.8 in  January  2002  and  escalating
competitive  activity.  Identical and comparable  store sales decreased 0.9% and
0.4%,  respectively,  in 2002 as compared  to 2001.  Management  estimates  that
overall  deflation in products the Company sells was 0.1% and 0.3% in the twelve
months ended January 30, 2003 and January 31, 2002, respectively.

     During 2002 the Company  opened 59  combination  food and drug  stores,  31
stand-alone  drugstores,  two  conventional  and  warehouse  stores  and 46 fuel
centers.  The Company closed or sold 140  combination  food and drug stores,  32
conventional  and  warehouse  stores,  54  stand-alone  drugstores  and 50  fuel
centers.  The Company also  remodeled 207 stores.  Net retail square  footage at
continuing  operations  was  92.1  million  square  feet  at the  end of 2002 as
compared to 92.8 million square feet at the end of 2001.

     Gross profit, as a percent to sales,  decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002
due to decreased  sales leverage as a result of the Labor Dispute and continued,
planned  investments  in pricing and promotion in key markets and  categories to
drive sales growth and market share.  These investments were partially offset by
savings generated from strategic sourcing initiatives,  increased pharmacy gross
margins as a result of a new supply contract and higher generic substitution and
increased private label sales growth.

     Gross profit, as a percent to sales,  increased in 2002 as compared to 2001
as a result of improved Company-wide  procurement practices,  increased pharmacy
margins due to higher  generic  substitutions  and the  Company's  restructuring
activities  in  2002  and  2001,  which  included  the  sale or  closure  of 245
underperforming stores.

     Selling,  general and administrative  (SG&A) expenses as a percent to sales
increased in 2003 as compared to 2002.  This  increase was  attributable  to the
lack of sales  leverage due to the Labor Dispute as well as higher  depreciation
costs  associated  with  the  Company's  continued   investment  in  information
technology  and  store  development;  increased  compensation  costs;  increased
workers compensation costs, primarily due to actual costs of prior years' claims
exceeding  prior years'  estimated  costs;  increased  employee  benefit  costs,
primarily  due to  increases in Company and union  sponsored  health and welfare
plans and increased  pension charges,  partially offset by a $36 gain associated
with the curtailment of postretirement  medical benefits for employees  retiring
after June 1, 2004; and contingent lease charges. The increased employee benefit
costs  experienced  during the year were due, in part, to increases in mandatory
contributions  to  multi-employer  health  care and  pension  plans to which the
Company  contributes.  Contribution  amounts are established under the Company's
collective bargaining agreements, which are up for renewal at varying times over
the next  several  years.  If the health care and  pension  plan  provisions  of
certain of these collective  bargaining  agreements  cannot be renegotiated in a
manner that reduces the prospective health care and pension costs of the Company
as the Company  intends,  the  Company's  selling,  general  and  administrative
expenses could continue to increase, possibly significantly, in the future.

     The increase in SG&A  expenses as a percent to sales in 2002 as compared to
2001 was primarily due to the reduction in the Company's  sales base as a result
of the 2001 restructuring  activities, an increase in employee benefit costs due
to mandatory contributions to multi-employer health and welfare plans and rising
workers'  compensation  costs.  These  increases  were  partially  offset by the
elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002 due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142
and a reduction in labor costs.

     The Company  recorded a $54 pre-tax gain during the fourth  quarter of 2001
resulting from the sale of 80 New England Osco drugstores.

     Interest  expense,  net,  during 2003 totaled $409 as compared with $396 in
the  prior  year.  This  increase  was   attributable  to  less  interest  being
capitalized on  construction  projects  during 2003. The decrease in capitalized
interest  was  due  to  an  overall  reduction  in  the  capital   expenditures,
particularly  for new  stores.  Interest  expense,  net,  was $425 in 2001.  The
decrease in 2002 from 2001 was due to lower  average debt  balances  outstanding
from year to year.

     Earnings from continuing  operations were $556 in 2003 compared to earnings
from continuing operations of $865 for 2002. This decrease was due to lost sales
and  earnings  associated  with  the  Labor  Dispute,   decreased  gross  margin
associated with planned  investments in pricing and promotion and an increase in
depreciation,  compensation  costs,  workers'  compensation  costs and  employee
benefits  costs.  Earnings from  continuing  operations  were $496 in 2001.  The
increase in income from  continuing  operations  in 2002 as compared to 2001 was
primarily attributable to the restructuring charges taken in 2001 related to the
sale  and  closure  of  165   underperforming   retail   stores,   reduction  of
administrative  and corporate overhead and consolidation and elimination of four
division offices.

     The Company's effective income tax rate from continuing operations for 2003
was 38.6%,  as  compared to 38.4% for 2002 and 42.6% for 2001.  The  decrease in
2002 as  compared  to  2001  was  the  result  of the  elimination  of  goodwill
amortization.

     Net earnings were $556 or $1.51 per diluted share for 2003, compared to net
earnings of $485 or $1.22 per diluted share for 2002.  The  improvement  in 2003
was a result of a charge of $379 in 2002 related to a strategic decision to exit
underperforming markets and a charge of $94 in 2002 related to the adoption of a
new accounting  principle for the recognition of vendor funds,  partially offset
by the reduction in earnings from  continuing  operations in 2003 as a result of
the Labor Dispute. Net earnings were $501 or $1.23 per diluted share for 2001.

Restructuring and Discontinued Operations
     The  financial   statement   presentation   includes  the  results  of  two
significant restructuring initiatives that were implemented in 2001 and 2002. In
July 2001, the Company's Board of Directors  approved a restructuring  plan that
included  the  closure  of  165  underperforming  retail  stores,  reduction  of
administrative  and corporate overhead and consolidation and elimination of four
division  offices  (refer  to  Note  6  "Restructuring"  in  the  notes  to  the
accompanying  consolidated financial  statements).  In March 2002, the Company's
Board of Directors  approved the second  phase of the  restructuring  plan which
included the complete exit of four underperforming markets resulting in the sale
or closure of 95 stores and two  distribution  centers and reduction of division
offices from 15 to 11 (refer to Note 5 "Discontinued Operations/Market Exits" in
the notes to the accompanying  consolidated financial statements).  Although the
initiatives  were  similar,  the  adoption of SFAS No. 144  "Accounting  for the

                                       19
<PAGE>

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" on February 1, 2002 resulted in the
financial statement presentation of these actions to be dissimilar (SFAS No. 144
does not allow for the retroactive application of its provisions). The Company's
2002 and 2001 financial statements classify the results of operations for the 95
stores  and  two  distribution  centers  divested  in  the  2002  initiative  as
discontinued operations. The operating results of the 165 stores divested in the
2001 initiative and the  restructuring  charges  associated with the decision to
sell or  close  those  stores  are  included  in  continuing  operations  of the
Company's financial statements for the periods prior to their sale or closure.

Phase 1: Restructuring
     In the first half of 2001, the Company initiated a profitability  review of
all of its retail  stores,  utilizing a methodology  based on return on invested
capital.  The Company also evaluated its division  management  structure and the
efficiency of its transaction processing departments. Based on these reviews, in
July 2001 the Company committed to the following  restructuring  activities:  1)
close and dispose of 165 underperforming  stores in 25 states; 2) eliminate four
of the then existing 19 division offices; 3) sell a store fixture  manufacturing
operation;  4) centralize  certain  transaction  processing  functions in Boise,
Idaho; and 5) reduce general office head count.

     These  restructuring   activities  called  for  the  elimination  of  1,341
managerial and administrative  positions  (excluding store level  terminations).
The  restructuring  charge  recorded in 2001  included the  following:  employee
severance  and  outplacement  costs of $44;  asset  impairments  of $361;  lease
termination costs of $57; and other costs of $6.

     In 2001 and 2002 respectively, 80 and 82 stores were closed or sold and 995
and 297  managerial and  administrative  employees  were  terminated  under this
restructuring  plan.  In 2002,  management  revised  the  planned  restructuring
activities as follows: the store fixture manufacturing  operation's  performance
was  re-evaluated  and  determined  to be more  cost-effective  than  purchasing
like-fixtures from external sources in the future, so it would be held and used;
one store's operating performance improved due to local market conditions, so it
would  also be  held  and  used;  and one  part  of the  transaction  processing
consolidation  was halted  due to a decision  to  replace  the  Company's  human
resource  information  systems  (HRIS) to be  completed by 2006.  All  remaining
stores in this restructuring plan were sold or closed by 2003.

     The reserve balances of $19 at January 29, 2004 and $28 at January 30, 2003
are included in other current liabilities in the Company's  Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  The related  assets are recorded at their  estimated  fair value,  less
selling  costs,  of $13 as of January 29,  2004 and  reported as assets held for
sale in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Phase 2: Discontinued Operations/Market Exits
     In March 2002  the Company's  Board of Directors  approved the second phase
of the Company's restructuring plan designed to improve future financial results
and to  drive  future  competitiveness.  This  phase of the  plan  included  the
complete exit of four underperforming markets:  Memphis,  Tennessee;  Nashville,
Tennessee;  Houston,  Texas; and San Antonio,  Texas.  This involved the sale or
closure of 95 stores and two distribution  centers and the reduction of division
offices  from 15 to 11.  The  facilities  identified  for sale or  closure  were
evaluated  for lease  liability and asset  impairment,  including  goodwill,  in
accordance with the Company's policy. The operating results and gains and losses
related to these market exits have been included in  discontinued  operations in
the Company's  Consolidated  Earnings. The prior years' operating activities for
these 95 stores, two distribution centers and reduction of division offices from
15 to 11 have been reported as Discontinued operations:  Operating (loss) income
in the accompanying Consolidated Earnings.

     The discontinued  operations generated sales of $290 and $1,326 in 2002 and
2001, respectively,  and an operating loss of $50 and operating profit of $10 in
2002 and 2001,  respectively.  The discontinued  operations were not material to
the 2003 Consolidated Earnings.  The loss from discontinued  operations was $286
in 2002 and consisted of a loss from  operations  of $50 and asset  impairments,
lease  settlements  and other costs of $379, net of $143 in income tax benefits.
The table below details the activity associated with the disposition.

</TABLE>

     The reserve  balances of $8 at January 29, 2004 and $11 at January 30, 2003
are included in other current liabilities in the Company's  Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

     Assets related to  discontinued  operations are recorded at their estimated
net realizable  value,  less selling costs, of $8 as of January 29, 2004 and are
reported as assets held for sale in the Company's  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.
These assets include land, buildings,  equipment and leasehold  improvements and
are being  actively  marketed.  As of January 30,  2003,  all 95 stores and both
distribution  centers were closed.  In addition,  the Company had either sold or
terminated  the  leases  related  to 80 of the 95 stores  and both  distribution
centers as of January 29, 2004.

     2003  unfavorable  lease  settlement  charges are  included  in  continuing
operations as part of selling, general and administrative expenses.

     Other consists of amounts paid in connection with notification  regulations
and negotiated contract terminations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
     Cash provided by operating  activities during 2003 was $1,545,  compared to
$2,060 in 2002 and $2,009 in 2001.  The  decrease in cash  provided by operating
activities  in 2003 as  compared  to 2002 was  primarily  due to lower  earnings
before  interest,   taxes,   depreciation   and  amortization   from  continuing
operations, a reduction in accounts payable due to lower inventory purchases and
inventory  turns in the Southern  California  Division  directly  related to the
Labor  Dispute and  increased  inventory  levels as a result of increased  store
count.  These uses of cash were partially offset by a reduction in the Company's
current  income  tax  payable  as a result  of  implementation  of tax  planning
initiatives  in 2003. In 2002,  cash flows from  operations  increased  slightly
primarily  as the result of better  inventory  leverage  in 2002 as  compared to
2001.  With the resolution of the Labor Dispute,  management  expects  operating
cash flows in 2004 to increase slowly as affected stores rebuild market share in
southern California.

     Cash flow used in investing  activities for 2003 increased to $926 compared
to $662 in 2002.  This increase was a result of 2002 investing  activities  that
included  proceeds from the sale of assets  (primarily  associated with the 2001
restructuring  activities and the 2002 market exits) that were $488 greater than
asset  sale  proceeds  received  in 2003,  partially  offset  by  lower  capital
expenditures in 2003. Capital expenditures  declined $265 in 2003 as compared to
2002,  primarily due to amounts invested in new store and store remodels in 2003
being partially offset by increased expenditures on information technology.  The
Company expects capital  expenditures  in 2004 to be  approximately  $300 higher
than those in 2003 due to the proposed  acquisition of Shaw's and expects  other
investing related activities to remain level.

                                       22
<PAGE>


     Cash flows used in investing  activities in 2002 decreased $418 as compared
to 2001 primarily due to cash received from the sale of assets  associated  with
the 2001 restructuring and 2002 market exits. Capital expenditures decreased $96
due to  reduced  spending  on new  store  construction  and  store  acquisitions
partially   offset  by  increased   spending  on  existing  store  upgrades  and
remodeling.

     The  Company's  financing  activities  for  2003,  2002 and  2001  included
payments on  long-term  borrowings,  stock  purchased  and retired and  dividend
payments. Cash flow used in financing activities in 2003 was $492 as compared to
$1,297  and $905 in 2002 and  2001,  respectively.  The  primary  difference  in
financing  activity  cash flows was the  Company's  decision to  purchase  fewer
shares of its common stock in 2003. In 2002,  the Company  purchased $862 of its
common stock as compared to $108 in 2003.

     The Board of Directors,  at its March 2004 meeting,  maintained the regular
quarterly  cash  dividend of $0.19 per share,  for an  effective  annual rate of
$0.76 per share.

     The Company utilizes its commercial paper and bank line programs  primarily
to supplement cash requirements for seasonal fluctuations in working capital and
to fund its capital expenditure program. Accordingly,  commercial paper and bank
line borrowings will fluctuate  between  reporting  periods.  The Company had no
commercial  paper or bank line  borrowings  outstanding  at January  29, 2004 or
January 30, 2003. The Company expects to use commercial  paper to fund a portion
of the purchase price for Shaw's.

     The Company had three revolving  credit  facilities  totaling $1,400 during
2003.  The first  agreement,  a 364-day  revolving  credit  facility  with total
availability  of $100 was due to  expire in  February  2004 but  renewed  for an
additional  year to expire in February 2005. The second  agreement,  a revolving
credit facility with total availability of $350 was set to expire in March 2004,
but was  extended  through  July 2004.  The  Company  expects  to  replace  this
agreement. The third agreement,  a five-year  facility for $950, expires
in March  2005.  The  agreements  in place  at year  end  also  contain  certain
covenants,  the most  restrictive  of which  requires  the  Company to  maintain
consolidated  tangible  net worth,  as defined,  of at least  $3,000 and a fixed
charge coverage,  as defined,  of no less than 2.7 times. As of January 29, 2004
and January 30, 2003,  the Company was in  compliance  with these  requirements.
However,  due to goodwill  that is expected to be  generated  as a result of the
acquisition  of Shaw's, the Company will have to obtain a prospective  waiver of
the consolidated tangible net worth covenant under these agreements.  All of the
revolving  credit  agreements  contain an option  which would allow the Company,
upon due notice,  to convert any outstanding  amounts at the expiration dates to
term  loans,  as long  as the  Company  is in  compliance  with  the  terms  and
conditions of the related  agreements.  No borrowings were outstanding under the
credit facilities as of January 29, 2004 or January 30, 2003.

     Albertsons  filed a shelf  registration  statement  with the Securities and
Exchange  Commission,  which became  effective on February 13, 2001 ("2001 Shelf
Registration") to authorize the issuance of up to $3,000 in debt securities.  In
May  2001  the  Company   issued  $600  of  Term  Notes  under  the  2001  Shelf
Registration.  The Notes are composed of $200 of principal  bearing  interest at
7.25% due May 1, 2013 and $400 of principal  bearing interest at 8.0% due May 1,
2031.  Proceeds  were used  primarily to repay  borrowings  under the  Company's
commercial paper program.  During 2002 and 2003, no securities were issued under
the  2001  Registration  Statement.  As of  January  29,  2004,  $2,400  of debt
securities remain available for issuance under the 2001 Registration  Statement;
however,  there can be no assurance  that the Company will be able to issue debt
securities under this registration statement at terms acceptable to the Company.

     During 2002,  the Company  purchased and retired 35.1 million shares of its
common stock for $862, at an average price of $24.54 per share. During 2003, the
Company  repurchased  5.3  million  shares  of  its  common  stock  for a  total
expenditure  of $108 at an average  price of $20.26 per share.  On  December  5,
2003, the Board of Directors reauthorized a program authorizing  management,  at
their  discretion,  to purchase  and retire up to $500 of the  Company's  common
stock through  December 31, 2004. The Company may continue or, from time to time
suspend,  purchasing  shares under its stock purchase  program  without  notice,
depending on prevailing market  conditions,  alternate uses of capital and other
factors.

     The Company's  operating results continue to enhance its financial position
and  ability  to  continue  its  internal  expansion  program.  Cash  flows from
operations and available  borrowings are adequate to support  currently  planned
business operations, stock repurchases and capital expenditures. The Company has
short-term  financing  capacity  in the form of  commercial  paper or bank  line
borrowings  up to $1,400  and  long-term  capacity  under the 2001  Registration
Statement of $2,400.  The Company  intends to use a combination of  cash-on-hand
and commercial paper to finance the acquisition of Shaw's.

     As of January 29, 2004, the Company's credit ratings were as follows:

</TABLE>

     The Company does not have any credit rating  downgrade  triggers that would
accelerate repayment in the Company's fixed-term debt portfolio were a downgrade
in the  Company's  credit  ratings  to  occur.  Similarly,  a  downgrade  in the
Company's  credit  ratings  would not  affect  the  Company's  ability to borrow
amounts under the revolving credit facilities.  However,  any adverse changes to
the Company's  credit  ratings would  increase the cost of borrowings  under the
Company's credit facilities.  In addition, a downgrade could limit the Company's
ability to issue  commercial  paper.  Should this occur,  the Company might seek
alternative  sources of  funding,  including  the  issuance  of notes  under the
existing shelf registration statements. In addition, up to $1,400 could be drawn
upon from the Company's senior unsecured credit facilities. The Company does not
anticipate the acquisition of Shaw's to have an impact on its credit ratings.

Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Guarantees

Contractual Obligations
     The  Company  enters  into a variety of  legally  binding  obligations  and
commitments  in the normal course of its business.  The table below presents the
Company's long-term contractual obligations and commitments which are considered
to  represent  known future cash  payments  that the Company will be required to
make  under  existing  contractual  arrangements.  Some  amounts  are  based  on
management's  estimates and assumptions and amounts  actually paid may vary from
those reflected in the table.

</TABLE>

     (1)  The Company has  medium-term  notes and  debentures  that  contain put
          options that would require the Company to repay borrowed amounts prior
          to maturity.  Medium-term notes of $30 and $50 mature in July 2027 and
          April 2028,  respectively,  and have put options  exercisable  in July
          2007 and April 2008,  respectively.  Debentures  in the amount of $200
          mature in May 2037 and have a put option  exercisable in May 2009. For
          the  purpose of the table  above,  payments of these  obligations  are
          assumed to occur at maturity.
     (2)  Represents  the minimum rents payable and includes  leases  associated
          with closed stores accrued for under the Company's  restructuring  and
          closed  store  reserves.  Amounts are not offset by expected  sublease
          income.
     (3)  The Company has entered into supply  contracts  to purchase  specified
          quantities  of  electricity  and natural gas that have terms  through
          2006. The amounts  included in the table reflect  projected  purchases
          based on historical usage and contracted rates.
     (4)  In addition to the contracts  noted in this table,  the Company enters
          into supply contracts to purchase  products for resale in the ordinary
          course of business. This category of contracts covers a broad spectrum
          of products and sometimes includes specific merchandising  obligations
          relative to those products.  These supply contracts  typically include
          either a volume  commitment or a fixed expiration date;  pricing terms
          based on the vendor's  published list price;  termination  provisions;
          and other standard contractual considerations. There are a significant
          number of these contracts,  however they are typically cancelable upon
          return of  unearned  allowances  and  therefore  no amounts  have been
          included above.

                                       24

Commercial Commitments
     The  Company  had  outstanding  Letters of Credit of $103 as of January 29,
2004, all of which were issued under separate agreements with multiple financial
institutions.  These  agreements  are not associated  with the Company's  credit
facilities.  Of the $103  outstanding  at year end, $83 were standby  letters of
credit covering primarily workers' compensation or performance obligations.  The
remaining  $20 were  commercial  letters  of  credit  supporting  the  Company's
merchandise  import  program.  The  Company  paid  issuance  fees  that  varied,
depending  on type,  up to 0.90% of the  outstanding  balance  of the  letter of
credit.

Guarantees
     The Company provides guarantees,  indemnifications and assurances to others
in the ordinary course of its business. The Company has evaluated its agreements
that contain  guarantees  and  indemnification  clauses in  accordance  with the
guidance of FASB Interpretation No. 45,  "Guarantor's  Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees,  Including  Indirect  Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others".

     The Company is contingently  liable for certain  operating leases that were
assigned  to third  parties  in  connection  with  various  store  closures  and
dispositions.  If any of  these  third  parties  were to fail to  perform  their
obligations  under the lease,  the Company  could be  responsible  for the lease
obligations.  In 2003,  the Company  was  notified  that  certain of these third
parties have become insolvent and are seeking bankruptcy protection.  At January
29, 2004,  approximately  26 store leases for which the Company is  contingently
liable were subject to the  bankruptcy  proceedings of such third parties and 22
of such had been rejected by the applicable  third party.  The Company  recorded
pre-tax  charges of $20 in 2003,  which  represents the remaining  minimum lease
payments  and other  payment  obligations  under the 22  rejected  leases,  less
estimated  sublease  income  and  discounted  at the  Company's  credit-adjusted
risk-free  interest  rate.  As of January 29,  2004,  the Company had  remaining
guarantees  on  approximately  192 stores with leases  extending  through  2026.
Assuming that each respective  purchaser became insolvent,  an event the Company
believes to be remote  because of the wide  dispersion  among third  parties and
remedies available,  the minimum future undiscounted payments,  exclusive of any
potential sublease income, are $273.

     In  connection  with the merger  between the Company  and  American  Stores
Company,  the Company was made party to and  guaranteed a $200  American  Stores
Company  bank term note due July  2004;  this  obligation  is  reflected  in the
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 29, 2004.

     The Company enters into a wide range of indemnification arrangements in the
ordinary  course  of  business.   These  include  tort   indemnifications,   tax
indemnifications,  indemnifications  against  third party claims  arising out of
arrangements to provide  services to Albertsons and  indemnifications  in merger
and acquisition  agreements.  It is difficult to quantify the maximum  potential
liability under these indemnifications;  however at January 29, 2004 the Company
was not aware of any material liabilities arising from these indemnifications.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
     At January 29, 2004, the Company had no significant  investments  that were
accounted for under the equity method in accordance with  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the United  States.  Investments  that were accounted for
under the equity method at January 29, 2004, had no liabilities  associated with
them that were guaranteed by or that would be considered material to Albertsons.
Accordingly, the Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements with
unconsolidated entities.

Capital Expenditures
     The  Company is  committed  to keeping  its stores up to date.  In the last
three years, the Company has opened or remodeled 693 stores, representing 32% of
the  Company's  retail  square  footage as of January 29,  2004.  The  following
summary of historical  capital  expenditures  includes  capital  leases,  stores
acquired in business and asset  acquisitions  and assets  acquired  with related
debt:

================================================================ ============ ============ ===========

     Total capital  expenditures  include capitalized lease obligations incurred
of $62 in 2003, $75 in 2002 and $79 in 2001.

                                       25
<PAGE>

     The Company's  financial  position provides the flexibility for the Company
to grow  through  its store  development  program and future  acquisitions.  The
Company's  capital  expenditure  budget  for 2004 is  approximately  $1,300  and
includes approximately $100 in new capital and operating lease obligations.  The
Company expects  capital  expenditures  to be  approximately  $300 higher if the
proposed acquisition of Shaw's is consummated.

Related Party Transactions
     Transactions with related parties were not considered material. See Note 20
"Related Party Transactions" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies
     The  Company's  discussion  and  analysis of its  financial  condition  and
results  of  operations  are based  upon the  Company's  consolidated  financial
statements,  which have been prepared in accordance with  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the United States.  The  preparation  of these  financial
statements  requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported  amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  and related
disclosure  of  contingent  assets and  liabilities.  On an ongoing  basis,  the
Company  evaluates  its  estimates,   including  those  related  to  bad  debts,
inventories,  vendor funds,  intangible  assets,  income taxes,  assets held for
sale, impairment of long-lived assets,  self-insurance,  restructuring,  benefit
costs,  contingencies,  litigation  and unearned  income.  The Company bases its
estimates on historical  experience and on various other assumptions and factors
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for  making  judgments  about the  carrying  values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company, based
on its ongoing  review,  will make  adjustments  to its  judgments and estimates
where facts and  circumstances  dictate.  Historically,  actual results have not
significantly  deviated  from those  determined  using the  estimates  described
above.

     The  Company  believes  the  following  critical  accounting  policies  are
important to the portrayal of the Company's  financial condition and results and
require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a
result of the need to make  estimates  about  the  effect  of  matters  that are
inherently uncertain.

VENDOR FUNDS The Company  receives funds from many of the vendors whose products
the Company  buys for resale in its stores.  These  vendor funds are provided to
increase the  sell-through of the related  products.  The Company receives funds
for a variety of merchandising activities: placement of the vendor's products in
the  Company's  advertising;  placement  of the  vendor's  products in prominent
locations  in the  Company's  stores;  introduction  of new  products  into  the
Company's  distribution system and retail stores;  exclusivity rights in certain
categories that have  slower-turning  products;  and to compensate for temporary
price  reductions  offered  to  customers  on  products  held for sale at retail
stores.  The Company also receives vendor funds for buying  activities,  such as
volume  commitment  rebates and credits  for  purchasing  products in advance of
their  need.  The  terms of  vendor  funds  arrangements  vary in  length,  from
short-term  arrangements  that are  completed  within a  quarter,  to  long-term
arrangements that are expected to be completed within ten years.

     Accounting  for vendor  funds is  discussed  in Emerging  Issues Task Force
"EITF" Issue 02-16:  Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain
Consideration  Received from a Vendor (EITF 02-16), which the Company adopted as
of the  beginning  of 2002.  As a result of this  guidance,  the  Company  began
recognizing the vendor funds for merchandising activities as a reduction of cost
of sales when the related products are sold as opposed to the previous method of
recognizing these credits as a reduction to cost of sales when the merchandising
activity was  performed in accordance  with the  underlying  agreements.  Vendor
funds that have been earned as a result of completing  the required  performance
under the terms of the  underlying  agreements but for which the product has not
yet been sold are  recognized as  reductions of inventory.  The amount of vendor
funds remaining in ending inventory requires  management judgment and estimates.
Management estimates these amounts based on the average inventory turnover rates
by product  category for the Company's  grocery,  general  merchandise and lobby
departments  and by  average  inventory  turnover  rates by  department  for the
Company's remaining inventory. The amount of vendor funds reducing the Company's
inventory  ("inventory  offset") as of January 29, 2004 was $155, an increase of
$3 from the beginning of 2003. The vendor funds  inventory  offset as of January
30, 2003 was $152, a decrease of $6 from the beginning of 2002.

LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS The Company regularly reviews long-lived assets for
indicators  of  impairment.  Management's  judgments  regarding the existence of
impairment indicators are based on operational performance.  Future events could
cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value
of  long-lived  assets is  impaired.  When  events or changes  in  circumstances
indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of an  asset  or an  asset  group  is  not
recoverable,  the fair value of the asset is  compared  to its  carrying  value.
Impairment  losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the
asset exceeds its estimated  fair value.  The estimated fair value of the assets
is determined  by internal real estate  specialists  or by  independent  quotes.
These estimates can be  significantly  impacted by changes in real estate market
conditions, the economic environment and inflation.

     For properties  that have closed and are under  long-term  operating  lease
agreements,  the  present  value of any  remaining  liability  under the  lease,
discounted  using credit  risk-free rates and net of estimated  sublease rentals
that could be reasonably obtained for the property, is recognized as a liability
and charged to operations. The value of any equipment and leasehold improvements
related to a closed store is reduced to reflect net recoverable values. Internal
real estate specialists  estimate the subtenant income and asset recovery values
based on their  historical  experience  and knowledge of (1) the market in which
the store to be closed is  located,  (2) the results of the  Company's  previous
efforts to dispose of similar  assets and (3) the current  economic  conditions.
The actual cost of  disposition  for these leases and related assets is affected
by specific real estate markets, the economic environment and inflation.

GOODWILL  The Company  adopted  SFAS No.  142,  "Goodwill  and Other  Intangible
Assets," in 2002. Upon adoption,  the aggregate of the goodwill allocated to the
stores in each reporting unit became the reporting units' goodwill  balance.  In
order to determine if a reporting unit's goodwill was impaired, a combination of
internal analysis, focusing on each reporting unit's implied EBITDA multiple and
estimates of fair value from independent  valuation specialists were used. Based
on these  analyses,  there was no impairment  of goodwill at the adoption  date.
Subsequently,  during the fourth quarter of 2002 and 2003, the Company completed
its annual  impairment  review and determined that there was no impairment.  The
fair value  estimates  could  change in the future  depending  on  internal  and
external factors, including the success of strategic sourcing initiatives, labor
cost controls and competitive activity.

SELF-INSURANCE The Company is primarily self-insured for property loss, workers'
compensation,  automobile  liability  costs and  general  liability  costs.  The
Company records its self-insurance liability,  determined actuarially,  based on
claims  filed and an  estimate  of claims  incurred  but not yet  reported.  Any
actuarial  projection  of  ultimate  losses  is  subject  to a  high  degree  of
variability.  Sources of this variability are numerous and include,  but are not
limited to, future development of previous claims,  future economic  conditions,
court decisions and legislative actions. For example, workers compensation costs
were $361,  $282 and $224 in 2003, 2002 and 2001  respectively.  The increase in
costs was primarily  attributable  to development of prior year claims that were
higher  than   previously   estimated   while  the  annual  number  of  workers'
compensation claims has decreased year to year.

     The Company's workers'  compensation  liabilities are from claims occurring
in various  states.  Individual  state workers'  compensation  regulations  have
received a tremendous  amount of  attention  from state  politicians,  insurers,
employers  and  providers,  as well as the public in general.  Recent years have
seen an escalation in the number of legislative  reforms,  judicial  rulings and
social  phenomena  affecting  workers'  compensation.  The  changes in a state's
political and economic  environment increase the variability in the unpaid claim
liabilities. The Company's workers' compensation reserves do not contemplate any
of these potential developments.

LEGAL  CONTINGENCIES The Company records reserves for legal  contingencies  when
the  information  available to the Company  indicates that it is probable that a
liability  has been  incurred  and the  amount  of the  loss  can be  reasonably
estimated.  Predicting  the  outcomes of claims and  litigation  and  estimating
related costs and exposures involve  substantial  uncertainties that could cause
actual  costs to vary  materially  from  estimates.  In  addition,  the  Company
regularly monitors its exposure to the loss contingencies  associated with these
matters  and may from  time to time  change  its  predictions  with  respect  to
outcomes and its estimates  with respect to related costs and  exposures.  It is
possible  that  material  differences  in actual  outcomes,  costs and exposures
relative to current  predictions  and  estimates,  or  material  changes in such
predictions or estimates,  could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

PENSION COSTS Pension benefit  obligations and the related effects on operations
are dependent on the Company's selection of actuarial assumptions, including the
discount rate and the expected  long-term rate of return on plan assets.  Actual
returns on plan assets  exceeded return  assumptions  over an extended period in
the past,  which kept  pension  expense and cash  contributions  to the plans at
modest levels.  Weaker market  performance may  significantly  increase  pension
expense and cash contributions in the future. Changes in the interest rates used
to determine the discount rate may also cause  volatility in pension expense and
cash  contributions.  Actual results that differ from the Company's  assumptions

                                       27
<PAGE>

are  accumulated  and amortized  over future periods and,  therefore,  generally
affect the Company's  recognized expense and recorded  obligation in such future
periods.  For example,  in 2003 the Company's discount rate assumption was 6.15%
and its long-term asset return assumption was 8.0%. Using these assumptions, the
Company's  2003 pension  expense was $30,  following  expense of $12 in 2002 and
income of $9 in 2001. If the Company had  decreased its estimated  discount rate
to 5.9% and its  expected  return on plan  assets to 7.5%,  the  Company's  2003
pension  expense  would  have been $37 and net  earnings  would  have  decreased
approximately  $4. If the Company had increased its discount rate  assumption to
6.4% and its expected  return on plan assets to 8.5%, 2003 pension expense would
have been $24 and net earnings would have increased approximately $4.

Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards
     In July 2001 the Financial Accounting  Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 143,  "Accounting for Asset Retirement  Obligations"  ("SFAS No. 143"). This
statement   addresses   financial   accounting  and  reporting  for  obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible  long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 became effective for the Company on January
31,  2003 and did not  have a  material  effect  on the  Company's  consolidated
financial statements.
